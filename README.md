# TAG lang 0.0.1
Hello, my name is Sakline. I am a high school student who loves computers, movies and tv shows. This is my first programming language project which I named Tag. So, what is Tag? Right now, not much. But in future, I hope it turns into something. I want Tag to be a general purpose, high performance programming language that specializes in artificial intelligence and data science.

What I want to do with Tag in the near future:
1. As Tag is completely written in Python, it is currently not that efficient. This version is more of a proof of concept rather than the actual thing. So, I first want to write this entire interpreter in c++ and turn it into a compiler. I hope to finish this by mid June this year.
2. I then plan on integrating llvm to make the compiler more efficient and portable. I believe I can finish this by the end of the year.
3. After I have finished porting the code to LLVM, I plan on releasing it as an official first version.

Where I want Tag to be used:

Even though, I made Tag to be a general purpose language, I want Tag to specialize in some areas over the others:

1. High performance mathematical computation.
2. Natural Language Processing.
3. Task automation.
